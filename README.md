**We have implemented the following features to meet all project criteria:**

* Allure Reporting: Integrated into the full execution cycle.

* Test Steps: Every UI test contains descriptive steps for better traceability.

* API Attachments: Request and Response bodies are automatically attached to every API test report.

* Failure Screenshots: The system captures a screenshot of the browser automatically upon any UI test failure.



**Execution Evidence**
1. Dashboard Overview

The dashboard shows our total test suite execution. We achieved a 92% pass rate, with specific defects captured for analysis.


2. UI Test Steps (Requirement Proof)

Each test provides a step-by-step breakdown of actions taken during the test.

3. API Request & Response (Requirement Proof)

Our API tests include full data logs to verify communication with the server.

4. Failed UI Screenshots (Requirement Proof)

When a test fails (as seen in our 92% result), the report automatically attaches a "Crime Scene" photo of the browser.
